I am a second year PhD student at [Khalifa University](https://www.ku.ac.ae/), supervised by [Prof. Muzammal Naseer](https://muzammal-naseer.com/). Before that, I received my BSc(Eng) degree from [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/). From 2023, I have the opportunity to collaborate with [MMLab@NTU](https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/index.html), working closely with [Jingkang Yang](https://jingkang50.github.io/) and being supervised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/).
